# EcoMath.jl
A Julia module for the analysis of ecological systems. Currently a work in progress but already has some useful functionalities which we explore in our [introductory notebook](https://github.com/pujaltes/EcoMath.jl/blob/main/examples/Introduction.ipynb). 


## Acknowledgements
This project has it's origin in the postgraduate Ecological Mathematics course taught by [Dr. Marco Tulio Angulo](https://www.matem-juriquilla.unam.mx/Marco_Angulo) at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 2022. We use Turing.jl thoughout and we drew heavy inspiration from their [tutorials](https://turing.ml/v0.22/tutorials/).
